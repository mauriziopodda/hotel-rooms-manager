# hotel-rooms-manager

An hotel rooms manager that shows the hotel room facilities, occupancy status, cleaning status and more...

Uses:

- `vite` as server

- `stitches` for styling
- `eslint` and `prettier` for code linting
- `moment` to manage the dates

## How to start the application

1. Download the package
2. `yarn install` (or npm, pnpm or other package manager)
3. `yarn dev` to start
4. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` (ot whatever other port you will setup in the `vite.config.ts`)
